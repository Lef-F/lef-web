            <h1>A very poetic Python üêç</h1>
            <p>
                I have been using Python for all sorts of things in the past years. 
                Data science, music, scripting, automation, puzzle solving, web UI apps, 
                serverless apps and more.
                Yet throughout all this time I've constantly changed the ways in which I setup Python itself, 
                virtual environments for my projects, package managers and 
                all the peripherals of the POSIX world.

                I managed to upgrade to 12.3 just fine, but I have yet to purge my Python setup.

                <h3>Update 2</h3>
                I finally got some time to continue, now I have purged most Python versions and their peripherals from my system.
                Almost fresh start! Almost too fresh, while deleting things I accidentally ran <code>rm -rf ~/Library/</code>
                instead of <code>rm -rf ~/Library/Python</code>. I realized it early and cancelled it 
                but I have no way to know if I deleted anything crucial...
                A restart will tell.</br>
                Stay tuned! üëæ
