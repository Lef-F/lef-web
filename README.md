## Dev Setup

1. Run `npm install` to install the dev dependencies that will make your life easier.
2. Run `npm run start` in order to start the local server so you can see your changes IRL over at [127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080)
3. Run `npm run cssmin` in order to update the minified version of the CSS files.
    - Needs to be run only if you made changes to `src/tufte.css`
2. _(Optional)_ Install the necessary Python tools by running [`poetry install`](https://python-poetry.org/) inside the `tools/` folder.
    - _Note: There's currently no other dependencies than [`black`](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)_
