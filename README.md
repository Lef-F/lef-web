## Dev Setup

1. Run `npm install clean-css-cli -g` in order to produce the minified version of the CSS files.
    - `cleancss -o src/tufte.min.css src/tufte.css`
    - Needs to be run only if you made changes to `src/tufte.css`
2. _(Optional)_ Install the necessary Python tools by running [`poetry install`](https://python-poetry.org/) inside the `tools/` folder.
    - _Note: There's currently no other dependencies than [`black`](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)_
